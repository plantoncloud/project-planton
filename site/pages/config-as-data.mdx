## Configuration as Data

**Kelsey Hightower**, champions the concept
of [Configuration as Data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes).
This approach treats configuration files as declarative dataâ€”specifying **what** you want rather than **how** to achieve
it.

In **Project Planton**, we embrace this philosophy by allowing you to define your multi-cloud infrastructure and
applications using simple YAML manifests that resemble Kubernetes resources. This means:

- **Simplicity**: You focus on declaring the desired state, and the system handles the rest.
- **Consistency**: Use the same configurations across different cloud providers without worrying about underlying
complexities.
- **Automation**: The Pulumi modules interpret your configurations and automate the provisioning process.

By following Kelsey Hightower's insights on Configuration as Data, Project Planton simplifies multi-cloud deployments,
making them more manageable and efficient.
