# Project Planton: Simplify Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment

**Effortlessly deploy complex infrastructure across any cloud provider using simple YAML manifests and powerful
automation.**

## TL;DR

Project Planton is an open-source framework that brings the simplicity of Kubernetes-like declarative configuration to
multi-cloud environments. It enables you to:

- **Define Once, Deploy Anywhere**: Write your infrastructure configurations in YAML manifests and deploy seamlessly
  across AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.
- **Leverage Unified Resource Model (MURM)**: Use a consistent API to manage resources across different cloud providers.
- **Automate with Pulumi Modules**: Benefit from well-crafted Pulumi modules that handle the heavy lifting of
  infrastructure provisioning.
- **Use an Intuitive CLI**: Deploy and manage your infrastructure effortlessly with a command-line tool that understands
  your manifests.

**Get Started in 3 Easy Steps:**

1. **Install the CLI Tool**

   ```bash
   brew install plantoncloud/tap/project-planton
   ```

2. **Create a YAML Manifest**

   Define your infrastructure in a simple YAML file for any of the
   available [Deployment Components](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider)
   using familiar Kubernetes-like resources. Here is the example
   for [Redis On Kubernetes](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/kubernetes/rediskubernetes/v1)
   deployment component.

   You can create similar manifests
   for [AWS VPC](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/aws/awsvpcv1), [GKE Cluster](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/gcp/gkecluster/v1), [Kafka on Kubernetes](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/kubernetes/kafkakubernetes/v1)
   or [Kafka On ConfluentCloud](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/confluent/kafkaconfluent/v1)
   and [many more](https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider).

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.project.planton/v1
kind: RedisKubernetes
metadata:
  name: payments
  id: payments-namespace
spec:
  container:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 2Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
    isPersistenceEnabled: true
    diskSize: 1Gi
```

3. **Deploy Your Infrastructure**

The above manifest is the input
for [redis-kubernetes-pulumi-module](https://github.com/plantoncloud/redis-kubernetes-pulumi-module). Running the
following command will read the manifest and set it up as input for the pulumi module.

   ```bash
   project-planton pulumi up --manifest redis.yaml
   ```

## Core Tenets

Project Planton is built upon three foundational pillars that collectively provide a seamless multi-cloud deployment
experience:

1. **Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)**
    - **Consistent Declarative APIs**: Define infrastructure and deployment components using a unified set of APIs
      across all cloud providers.
    - **Simplified Configuration**: Abstract away cloud-specific complexities with a model inspired by Kubernetes
      Resource Model (KRM), allowing you to focus on what you want to deploy rather than how to deploy it.

2. **Well-Written Pulumi Modules**
    - **Robust Infrastructure as Code**: Each deployment component is backed by meticulously crafted Pulumi modules.
    - **Cross-Language Support**: Leverage Pulumi's multi-language capabilities to handle the provisioning of resources
      on various cloud platforms seamlessly.
    - **Abstraction of Complexity**: Let the Pulumi modules manage the intricate details of cloud services so you can
      concentrate on your application's needs.

3. **Intuitive CLI Tooling**
    - **Simplified Deployment Process**: Use a command-line interface that understands both the MURM and the Pulumi
      modules to deploy infrastructure with ease.
    - **YAML Manifest Configuration**: Write your deployment component configurations in simple YAML manifests, making
      it accessible and easy to version control.
    - **Instant Feedback and Iteration**: Modify your config manifests and re-run deployments to preview changes before
      applying them, facilitating rapid development and testing.

**By integrating these three core tenets, Project Planton enables you to define your infrastructure once and deploy it
anywhere, significantly reducing the complexity and overhead of multi-cloud management.**

# Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)

Project Planton is an open-source framework that brings the declarative design principles of the [Kubernetes Resource
Model (KRM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/acc25e14ca83dfda4f66d8cb1f1b491f26e78ffe/architecture/resource-management.md)
to multi-cloud environments. By leveraging
well-written [Pulumi Modules](https://github.com/orgs/plantoncloud/repositories?q=pulumi-module) and a straightforward
CLI tool, Project Planton
enables developers to define and deploy infrastructure and applications across multiple cloud providers using
declarative configurations.

Project Planton aims to simplify the deployment of microservices, popular open-source software infrastructure, cloud
infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using a consistent, declarative approach. Developers often struggle with
the complexity and inconsistencies of deploying infrastructure on different clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

With Project Planton, a developer can define their infrastructure and application configurations in a YAML manifest
using familiar Kubernetes-like API resources. By running a single CLI command, the specified Pulumi modules are
automatically fetched and executed to bring the desired state to reality on the target cloud platforms. This means a
developer can focus on writing the application and its configuration once, and deploy it consistently across any
supported cloud environment without dealing with cloud-specific nuances. This accelerates development, reduces the
learning curve for multi-cloud deployment, and ensures that infrastructure remains consistent and manageable.

## Configuration as Data

**Kelsey Hightower**, champions the concept
of [Configuration as Data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes).
This approach treats configuration files as declarative dataâ€”specifying **what** you want rather than **how** to achieve
it.

In **Project Planton**, we embrace this philosophy by allowing you to define your multi-cloud infrastructure and
applications using simple YAML manifests that resemble Kubernetes resources. This means:

- **Simplicity**: You focus on declaring the desired state, and the system handles the rest.
- **Consistency**: Use the same configurations across different cloud providers without worrying about underlying
  complexities.
- **Automation**: The Pulumi modules interpret your configurations and automate the provisioning process.

![Configuration as Data](/images/concepts/config-as-data.png)

By following Kelsey Hightower's insights on Configuration as Data, Project Planton simplifies multi-cloud deployments,
making them more manageable and efficient.

## Quick Examples

* [Deploy Redis on Kubernetes](quick-examples/kubernetes/redis.mdx)
* [Deploy GKE Cluster](quick-examples/gcp/gke-cluster.mdx)

## Key Features

- **Declarative Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Define your infrastructure and application configurations using
  Kubernetes-like YAML manifests. Deploy across multiple cloud providers seamlessly, ensuring consistency and reducing
  complexity.

- **Pulumi Module Integration**: Leverage Pulumi modules versioned and hosted in their own repositories. These modules
  handle the provisioning of resources declared in your manifests, bringing your desired state into reality when you
  trigger them.

- **Familiar API Design**: Utilize API resources modeled after the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), including `version`,
  `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This familiar structure makes it easier for developers with
  Kubernetes experience to adopt and use.

- **CLI Tooling**: Install the `project-planton` CLI via Homebrew (`brew install plantoncloud/tap/project-planton`) to
  manage your deployments effortlessly. The CLI handles fetching the necessary Pulumi modules and orchestrates the
  deployment process based on your manifests.

- **Extensible and Open Source**: All APIs are defined using Protocol Buffers and published to the Buf Schema Registry (
  BSR), providing readily available documentation and SDK generation in multiple languages. The open-source nature
  encourages community contributions and transparency.

- **Advanced Validation**: Field validations are embedded within the protobuf definitions using Protovalidate and Common
  Expression Language (CEL). This ensures configurations are correct and reduces errors during deployment.

## Getting Started

To start using **Project Planton**, follow the steps below to set up your environment and deploy your first manifest.

### Prerequisites

- **Pulumi Installed**: Ensure you have [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/) installed on your
  machine.
- **Cloud Provider Credentials**: Set up credentials for the cloud providers you plan to use (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google
  Cloud, Kubernetes, Confluent Cloud etc). Refer to Pulumi's documentation
  on [cloud provider setup](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/)
  for guidance.

### Installation

1. **Install the CLI Tool**

   Install the Project Planton CLI if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   brew install plantoncloud/tap/project-planton
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation**

   Confirm that the CLI is installed correctly by checking its version:

   ```bash
   project-planton --version
   ```

### Creating a Manifest

Create a YAML manifest file that defines your desired infrastructure or application configuration. Here's an example of
a simple manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.project.planton/v1
kind: GcsBucket
metadata:
  name: example-storage-bucket
spec:
  gcpProjectId: gcp-project-id
  gcpRegion: us-west-1
```

### Deploying Your Manifest

Use the Project Planton CLI to deploy your manifest:

```bash
project-planton pulumi up --manifest manifest.yaml --gcp-credential gcp-credential.yaml
```

This command will:

- Download the appropriate Pulumi module based on the `kind` specified in your manifest.
- Pass the manifest and Kubernetes cluster information to the Pulumi module.
- Execute the Pulumi stack to provision the resources as declared in your manifest.

## How It Works

Project Planton bridges the gap between Kubernetes' declarative resource model and multi-cloud deployments by leveraging
Pulumi modules and a simple CLI tool. Here's an overview of how the system operates:

1. **Declarative Manifests**: Users define their desired infrastructure or application configurations in YAML manifests,
   following the familiar structure of Kubernetes resources with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status`.

2. **Protocol Buffers Definitions**: These manifests correspond to API resources defined in Protocol Buffers (protobuf).
   The APIs are published to the Buf Schema Registry (BSR), providing accessible documentation and on-demand SDK
   generation in multiple languages.

3. **Field Validation**: Validations are embedded within the protobuf definitions using Protovalidate and Common
   Expression Language (CEL). This ensures that the configurations adhere to the expected formats and constraints before
   deployment.

4. **CLI Execution**: When the user runs the `project-planton` CLI command, the tool performs the following actions:
    - **Module Retrieval**: It identifies the appropriate Pulumi module repository for the specified deployment
      component (e.g., a Kubernetes cluster, database service, etc.).
    - **Pulumi Module Execution**: It clones the Pulumi module and passes the manifest and any additional configuration
      to it.
    - **State Management**: Users manage the Pulumi state backend, ensuring that state is preserved across deployments.
    - **Provisioning**: The Pulumi module uses the provided configurations to interact with the target cloud providers'
      APIs, provisioning the resources as declared.

5. **Desired State Realization**: Pulumi modules act similarly to Kubernetes controllers but are triggered manually by
   the user. They reconcile the declared state in the manifests with the actual state in the cloud environment, ensuring
   that the infrastructure matches the desired specifications.

6. **Status Reporting**: After deployment, the `status` field in the manifest can be updated to reflect the current
   state of the resources, providing feedback to the user.

    E --> F[Provision Resources on Cloud Provider]
    F --> G[Infrastructure & Applications Deployed]
```

### Advantages of This Approach

- **Consistency Across Clouds**: By abstracting cloud-specific details, developers can deploy resources to any supported
  cloud provider using the same declarative approach.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Pulumi modules are versioned and maintained in separate repositories, promoting reuse
  and ease of updates.
- **Transparency and Control**: Unlike automated controllers, users have explicit control over when deployments occur,
  allowing for better planning and coordination.

## Use Cases and Examples

### Use Case 1: Multi-Cloud Application Deployment

**Scenario**: A development team needs to deploy a microservices-based application across multiple cloud providers to
ensure high availability and reduce dependency on a single vendor.

**How Project Planton Helps**:

- **Unified Configuration**: Developers define their infrastructure and application components in a single YAML manifest
  using Project Planton's API resources.
- **Consistent Deployment**: By using the `project-planton` CLI, the team can deploy to AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
  seamlessly without altering the core configuration.
- **Simplified Management**: Updates and scaling can be managed centrally, reducing complexity and potential for errors.

### Use Case 2: Rapid Provisioning of Development Environments

**Scenario**: Individual developers require consistent and isolated development environments that mirror production for
testing new features.

**How Project Planton Helps**:

- **Reusable Manifests**: Developers can use predefined manifests to spin up their environments quickly, ensuring
  consistency across the team.
- **Automated Setup**: The Pulumi modules handle the provisioning of necessary resources like Kubernetes clusters,
  databases, and networking components.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Environments can be easily destroyed when not needed, optimizing resource usage and cost.

### Use Case 3: Infrastructure Migration

**Scenario**: An organization plans to migrate its applications from one cloud provider to another due to cost or
performance considerations.

**How Project Planton Helps**:

- **Cloud-Agnostic Configuration**: The same manifest can be adapted for different cloud providers with minimal changes.
- **Ease of Transition**: Pulumi modules abstract the underlying cloud specifics, allowing for a smoother migration
  process.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Consistent deployment practices reduce the risk of discrepancies between environments.

### Example Manifest

Here's an example of a manifest that deploys a backend api application and its required database:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.project.planton/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: todo-list-api
spec:
  version: main
  container:
    app:
      env:
        variables:
          DATABASE_NAME: todo
      image:
        repo: nginx
        tag: latest
      ports:
        - appProtocol: http
          containerPort: 8080
          isIngressPort: true
          servicePort: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 2000m
          memory: 2Gi
---
apiVersion: kubernetes.project.planton/v1
kind: RedisKubernetes
metadata:
  name: basic-redis
spec:
  container:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 256Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 1Gi
    is_persistence_enabled: false
  ingress:
    host: redis.example.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secretName: redis-tls
    rules:
      - path: /redis
        backend:
          serviceName: basic-redis-service
          servicePort: 6379
```

**Deployment Command**:

```bash
project-planton pulumi up --manifest ./example-manifest.yaml --kubernetes-cluster ./k8s-cluster.yaml
```

**Explanation**:

- The manifest defines two `DeploymentComponent` resources: one for the web application and one for the database.
- The `web-application` component specifies the Docker image, the number of replicas, and environment variables,
  including a reference to database credentials.
- The `database` component defines the database engine, version, storage size, and specifies the cloud provider and
  region.
- Running the deployment command will provision both components in the specified cloud environments, using the Pulumi
  modules to handle provider-specific details.
