//# Overview
//
//The **GCP Static Website API Resource** provides a consistent and standardized interface for deploying and managing static websites on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This resource simplifies the process of hosting static content using GCP services, allowing users to set up highly available and scalable websites without the complexity of managing servers or infrastructure.
//
//## Purpose
//
//We developed this API resource to streamline the deployment of static websites using GCP services such as Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud CDN. By offering a unified interface, it reduces the complexity involved in setting up hosting environments, enabling users to:
//
//- **Easily Deploy Static Websites**: Quickly host static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
//- **Enhance Performance**: Utilize Google Cloud CDN for global content delivery and reduced latency.
//- **Simplify Configuration**: Abstract the underlying GCP configurations for easier setup.
//- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Work within existing GCP projects and credentials.
//- **Focus on Content**: Allow developers and content creators to concentrate on website content rather than infrastructure.
//
//## Key Features
//
//- **Consistent Interface**: Aligns with our existing APIs for deploying open-source software, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.
//- **Simplified Deployment**: Automates the setup of Cloud Storage buckets, bucket policies, and CDN configurations.
//- **Scalability and Availability**: Leverages GCP infrastructure to ensure high availability and automatic scaling.
//- **Security**: Supports SSL/TLS encryption and IAM policies for secure content delivery.
//- **Cost-Effective**: Offers a pay-as-you-go model, minimizing costs for hosting static content.
//
//## Use Cases
//
//- **Corporate Websites**: Host company websites with static content and minimal backend logic.
//- **Landing Pages**: Quickly deploy marketing landing pages or promotional sites.
//- **Documentation Sites**: Publish static documentation generated from tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or MkDocs.
//- **Single Page Applications**: Deploy frontend applications built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
//- **Content Distribution**: Deliver static assets such as images, videos, and downloads efficiently.
//
//## Future Enhancements
//
//As this resource is currently in a partial implementation phase, future updates will include:
//
//- **Advanced Configuration Options**: Support for custom domain names, SSL certificates, and routing rules.
//- **Enhanced Security Features**: Integration with Google Cloud Armor for web application firewall protection.
//- **Logging and Monitoring**: Improved support for logging access requests and integrating with Google Cloud Monitoring.
//- **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: Streamlined deployment processes with integration into continuous deployment pipelines.
//- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Expanded usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.
