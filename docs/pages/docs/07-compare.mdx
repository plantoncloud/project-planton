# Comparison with Similar Tools

Understanding how **ProjectPlanton** differs from other tools can help you choose the right solution for your needs.
Here's how it compares to some existing tools in the market:

## Crossplane

**Overview**: Crossplane is an open-source project that allows you to manage cloud infrastructure and services using
Kubernetes-native APIs and control loops.

**Comparison**:

- **Requires Kubernetes Cluster**: Crossplane operates within a Kubernetes cluster, extending its API to manage external
resources.
- **Controller-Based Reconciliation**: Uses Kubernetes controllers to continuously reconcile desired and actual states,
which can add operational overhead.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Supports multiple cloud providers but is tightly coupled with Kubernetes.

**ProjectPlanton Advantages**:

- **No Kubernetes Dependency**: Does not require a Kubernetes cluster, reducing complexity and resource requirements.
- **On-Demand Execution**: Uses Pulumi modules that are triggered by the user, giving more control over when and how
changes are applied.
- **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminates the need for continuously running controllers, making it easier to manage.

## GCP Config Connector

**Overview**: GCP Config Connector is a Kubernetes add-on that allows you to manage Google Cloud resources through
Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

**Comparison**:

- **GCP Only**: Specifically designed for managing Google Cloud resources.
- **Requires Kubernetes Cluster**: Needs a Kubernetes cluster to function, adding operational overhead.

**ProjectPlanton Advantages**:

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Works across various cloud providers, not limited to Google Cloud.
- **No Kubernetes Requirement**: Operates independently of Kubernetes, simplifying deployment and management.

## SST (Serverless Stack)

**Overview**: SST is an open-source framework that makes it easy to build serverless applications on AWS.

**Comparison**:

- **AWS Only**: Focused exclusively on Amazon Web Services.
- **Opinionated Framework**: Provides a specific way of building applications, which may not suit all use cases.
- **TypeScript Only**: Infrastructure is defined using TypeScript, which might not be familiar to all developers.

**ProjectPlanton Advantages**:

- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Supports multiple cloud providers, offering greater flexibility.
- **Language Flexibility**: Uses YAML manifests and Pulumi modules, which can be written in various programming
languages.
- **Declarative Approach**: Follows Kubernetes-like declarative configuration, which may be more familiar to developers
used to KRM.

## Cloud Posse

**Overview**: Cloud Posse offers a collection of Terraform modules and tooling to manage AWS infrastructure.

**Comparison**:

- **AWS Only**: The modules are tailored for AWS services.
- **Terraform-Based**: Uses Terraform and HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which might have a steeper learning
curve.
- **Variable-Based Configuration**: Relies on Terraform variables for configuration, which can become complex in large
deployments.

**ProjectPlanton Advantages**:

- **Declarative YAML Configuration**: Utilizes Kubernetes-like YAML manifests for configuration, promoting readability
and ease of use.
- **Protocol Buffers and Validations**: Employs protobuf definitions with embedded validations using Protovalidate and
CEL, enhancing reliability.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Not limited to AWS, enabling deployments across different cloud environments.
