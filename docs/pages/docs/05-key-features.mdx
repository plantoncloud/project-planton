## Key Features

- **Declarative Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Define your infrastructure and application configurations using
Kubernetes-like YAML manifests. Deploy across multiple cloud providers seamlessly, ensuring consistency and reducing
complexity.

- **Pulumi Module Integration**: Leverage Pulumi modules versioned and hosted in their own repositories. These modules
handle the provisioning of resources declared in your manifests, bringing your desired state into reality when you
trigger them.

- **Familiar API Design**: Utilize API resources modeled after the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), including `version`,
`kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This familiar structure makes it easier for developers with
Kubernetes experience to adopt and use.

- **CLI Tooling**: Install the `project-planton` CLI via Homebrew (`brew install plantoncloud/tap/project-planton`) to
manage your deployments effortlessly. The CLI handles fetching the necessary Pulumi modules and orchestrates the
deployment process based on your manifests.

- **Extensible and Open Source**: All APIs are defined using Protocol Buffers and published to the Buf Schema Registry (
BSR), providing readily available documentation and SDK generation in multiple languages. The open-source nature
encourages community contributions and transparency.

- **Advanced Validation**: Field validations are embedded within the protobuf definitions using Protovalidate and Common
Expression Language (CEL). This ensures configurations are correct and reduces errors during deployment.
