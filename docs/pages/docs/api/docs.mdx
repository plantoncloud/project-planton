In the world of cloud infrastructure deployment, poor documentation can be a major blocker. Lack of up-to-date, interactive, and clear API documentation often leads to frustration, slow onboarding, and deployment errors. At ProjectPlanton, the critical importance of having robust and accessible documentation is understood, leading to Buf Schema Registry (BSR) being consciously chosen as the tool to provide the best possible experience for users.

## Problem w/ Traditional Docs

- **Stale Documentation**: Documentation often becomes outdated as APIs evolve, resulting in confusion and errors.
- **Complex Navigation**: Relationships between different API components can be difficult to trace, which slows down understanding.
- **Lack of Interactivity**: Interactive features are lacking in static documentation, making it difficult for developers to quickly grasp complex API connections.

## Buf Schema Registry

- **Always Up-to-Date**: Auto-generated documentation is provided by Buf Schema Registry, ensuring that the most current information is always available as APIs evolve.
- **Interactive and Visual**: With visual breadcrumbs and clickable links, complex relationships between API components are navigated seamlessly, enabling a better understanding of the bigger picture without unnecessary friction.
- **Accelerates Onboarding & Troubleshooting**: By making dependencies and type relationships clear at a glance, Onboarding is accelerated, and troubleshooting is simplified by BSR, allowing users to focus on effective infrastructure deployment.

## Benefits for Users

- **Always Current Documentation**: Documentation is regenerated every time APIs are updated, ensuring consistency and accuracy for users.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Resources can be easily explored using visual breadcrumbs and interactive navigation, enabling understanding of connections and avoiding manual exploration headaches.
- **Simplified Troubleshooting & Faster Onboarding**: Resource dependencies are easier to understand, leading to faster onboarding for new team members and reduced time spent troubleshooting complex issues.

## How It Works

- **Auto-Generated Docs**: Every API change results in new documentation, keeping everything in sync.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: An intuitive way to explore relationships between API types is provided through breadcrumb navigation, helping to avoid confusion and wasted time.
- **Visual & Interactive**: Different API resources can be clicked through by users to visually explore connections, ensuring a more effective documentation experience.

ProjectPlanton users benefit from clear, current, and interactive API documentation through Buf Schema Registry. By addressing the shortcomings of traditional documentation, ProjectPlanton ensures that developers and platform engineers can focus on deploying infrastructure smoothly, without the barriers of outdated or confusing documentation.
