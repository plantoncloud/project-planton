ProjectPlanton is built upon three foundational pillars that collectively provide a seamless multi-cloud deployment
experience:

1. **Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)**
2. **Well-Written Pulumi Modules**
3. **Intuitive CLI Tooling**

By integrating these three core tenets, ProjectPlanton enables you to define your infrastructure once and deploy it
anywhere, significantly reducing the complexity and overhead of multi-cloud management.**

*Skip the complexity of multi-cloud deployment. Focus on building great applications while ProjectPlanton handles the
infrastructure.*

## Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)

- *Consistent Declarative APIs*: Define infrastructure and deployment components using a unified set of APIs
across all cloud providers.

- *Simplified Configuration*: Abstract away cloud-specific complexities with a model inspired by Kubernetes
Resource Model (KRM), allowing you to focus on what you want to deploy rather than how to deploy it.

## Well-Written Pulumi Modules

- *Robust Infrastructure as Code*: Each deployment component is backed by meticulously crafted Pulumi modules.

- *Cross-Language Support*: Leverage Pulumi's multi-language capabilities to handle the provisioning of resources
on various cloud platforms seamlessly.

- *Abstraction of Complexity*: Let the Pulumi modules manage the intricate details of cloud services so you can
concentrate on your application's needs.

## Intuitive CLI Tooling

- *Simplified Deployment Process*: Use a command-line interface that understands both the MURM and the Pulumi
modules to deploy infrastructure with ease.

- *YAML Manifest Configuration*: Write your deployment component configurations in simple YAML manifests, making
it accessible and easy to version control.

- *Instant Feedback and Iteration*: Modify your config manifests and re-run deployments to preview changes before
applying them, facilitating rapid development and testing.
