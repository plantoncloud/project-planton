## Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)

Project Planton is an open-source framework that brings the declarative design principles of the [Kubernetes Resource
Model (KRM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/acc25e14ca83dfda4f66d8cb1f1b491f26e78ffe/architecture/resource-management.md)
to multi-cloud environments. By leveraging
well-written [Pulumi Modules](https://project-planton.org/pulumi-modules) and a straightforward
CLI tool, Project Planton
enables developers to define and deploy infrastructure and applications across multiple cloud providers using
declarative configurations.

Project Planton aims to simplify the deployment of microservices, popular open-source software infrastructure, cloud
infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using a consistent, declarative approach. Developers often struggle with
the complexity and inconsistencies of deploying infrastructure on different clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

With Project Planton, a developer can define their infrastructure and application configurations in a YAML manifest
using familiar Kubernetes-like API resources. By running a single CLI command, the specified Pulumi modules are
automatically fetched and executed to bring the desired state to reality on the target cloud platforms. This means a
developer can focus on writing the application and its configuration once, and deploy it consistently across any
supported cloud environment without dealing with cloud-specific nuances. This accelerates development, reduces the
learning curve for multi-cloud deployment, and ensures that infrastructure remains consistent and manageable.
