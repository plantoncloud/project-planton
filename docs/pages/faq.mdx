# FAQ

## Q: What is Project Planton?

**A:** Project Planton is an open-source framework that brings the declarative design principles of the Kubernetes
Resource Model (KRM) to multi-cloud environments. It allows developers to define and deploy infrastructure across
multiple cloud providers using familiar Kubernetes-like manifests and a simple CLI tool.

## Q: Do I need to know Pulumi to use Project Planton?

**A:** No, you don't need prior knowledge of Pulumi to use Project Planton. The `project-planton` CLI handles the
interaction with Pulumi modules behind the scenes. However, understanding Pulumi can enhance your ability to customize
and extend the modules if needed.

## Q: Which cloud providers are supported?

**A:** Project Planton aims to support all major cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
Support for additional providers can be added through community contributions.

## Q: How does Project Planton differ from Kubernetes?

**A:** While Project Planton is inspired by the Kubernetes Resource Model, it does not require a Kubernetes cluster to
operate. It focuses on multi-cloud deployments using a similar declarative approach but leverages Pulumi modules instead
of Kubernetes controllers.

## Q: Can I contribute my own Pulumi modules?

**A:** Yes, contributions are welcome! You can create and share your own Pulumi modules for different deployment
components. Please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines.
