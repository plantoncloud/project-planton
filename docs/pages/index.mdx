# Framework for Multi-Cloud Deployments

**Effortlessly deploy complex infrastructure across any cloud provider using simple YAML manifests and powerful
automation.**

## TL;DR

ProjectPlanton is an open-source framework that brings the simplicity of Kubernetes-like declarative configuration to
multi-cloud environments. It enables you to:

- **Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)**: Leverage simple, consistent [API](https://buf.build/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main:project/planton/provider)
  written in [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) and published
  to [Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/product/bsr) to manage resources across different cloud providers. In
  short, Kubernetes like Manifests, but for Multi-Cloud. Write your infrastructure configurations in YAML manifests and
  deploy seamlessly
  across AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

- **Automate with Pulumi Modules**: Benefit
  from [pre-written pulumi modules](module-git-repos.yaml) which takes
  [project-planton api](https://buf.build/plantoncloud/project-planton/tree/main:project/planton/provider) manifests as
  input and handle the heavy lifting of infrastructure provisioning.

- **ProjectPlanton APIs & Pulumi Modules aware CLI**: Deploy and manage your infrastructure effortlessly with a
  command-line tool that understands project-planton manifests and also knows which one of
  the [pre-written pulumi module](module-git-repos.yaml)
  to execute for the deployment.

## Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)

Project Planton is an open-source framework that brings the declarative design principles of the [Kubernetes Resource
Model (KRM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/acc25e14ca83dfda4f66d8cb1f1b491f26e78ffe/architecture/resource-management.md)
to multi-cloud environments. By leveraging
well-written [Pulumi Modules](https://github.com/orgs/plantoncloud/repositories?q=pulumi-module) and a straightforward
CLI tool, Project Planton
enables developers to define and deploy infrastructure and applications across multiple cloud providers using
declarative configurations.

Project Planton aims to simplify the deployment of microservices, popular open-source software infrastructure, cloud
infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using a consistent, declarative approach. Developers often struggle with
the complexity and inconsistencies of deploying infrastructure on different clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

With Project Planton, a developer can define their infrastructure and application configurations in a YAML manifest
using familiar Kubernetes-like API resources. By running a single CLI command, the specified Pulumi modules are
automatically fetched and executed to bring the desired state to reality on the target cloud platforms. This means a
developer can focus on writing the application and its configuration once, and deploy it consistently across any
supported cloud environment without dealing with cloud-specific nuances. This accelerates development, reduces the
learning curve for multi-cloud deployment, and ensures that infrastructure remains consistent and manageable.
