# Overview

The AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) API resource provides a consistent and streamlined interface for deploying and managing AWS VPCs within our cloud infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of VPC configurations, this resource allows you to define your network environments effortlessly while ensuring consistency and compliance across different environments.

## Why We Created This API Resource

Configuring AWS VPCs can be intricate due to the numerous networking components, best practices, and security considerations involved. To simplify this process and promote a standardized approach, we developed this API resource. It enables you to:

- **Simplify Network Configuration**: Easily set up VPCs with the desired CIDR blocks, subnets, and availability zones without dealing with low-level AWS networking details.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain uniform network architectures across different environments and projects.
- **Enhance Productivity**: Reduce the time and effort required to configure VPCs, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying applications.

## Key Features

### Environment Integration

- **Environment Info**: Seamlessly integrates with our environment management system to deploy VPCs within specific environments.
- **Stack Job Settings**: Supports custom stack job settings for infrastructure-as-code deployments.

### AWS Credential Management

- **AWS Credential ID**: Utilizes specified AWS credentials to ensure secure and authorized deployments.

### Customizable VPC Specifications

#### Network Configuration

- **VPC CIDR Block**: Define the IP address range for the VPC using CIDR notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
- **Availability Zones**: Specify the AWS availability zones to span the VPC (e.g., `["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]`).

#### Subnet Configuration

- **Subnets per Availability Zone**: Determine the number of subnets to create in each availability zone for better resource distribution and fault tolerance.
- **Subnet Size**: Specify the number of hosts in each subnet to control the subnet's IP address range.

#### NAT Gateway

- **NAT Gateway Enablement**: Toggle to enable or disable a NAT gateway for private subnets, allowing instances in private subnets to access the internet securely.

#### DNS Settings

- **DNS Hostnames**: Enable or disable DNS hostnames within the VPC to allow instances to have DNS names that resolve to their private IP addresses.
- **DNS Support**: Enable or disable DNS resolution through the Amazon-provided DNS server, which is essential for internal DNS resolution within the VPC.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: Abstracts the complexities of AWS VPC configurations into an easy-to-use API.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all VPCs adhere to organizational standards for networking, security, and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Allows for flexible network architectures that can grow with your application's needs.
- **Security**: Provides options to configure network isolation, control internet access, and manage DNS settings securely.
- **Flexibility**: Customize VPCs extensively to meet specific application requirements without compromising best practices.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource allocation by precisely controlling subnet sizes and NAT gateway usage.
