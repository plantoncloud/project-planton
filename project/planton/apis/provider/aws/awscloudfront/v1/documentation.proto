//# Overview
//
//The **AWS CloudFront API Resource** provides a standardized interface for deploying and managing Amazon CloudFront distributions within our infrastructure. This resource simplifies the integration of content delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance the performance and availability of web applications and services.
//
//## Purpose
//
//We created this API resource to streamline the deployment of AWS CloudFront services. By offering a consistent interface, it reduces the complexity involved in setting up and configuring CloudFront distributions, allowing users to:
//
//- Deploy new CloudFront distributions effortlessly
//- Configure caching behaviors and policies
//- Set up origin servers and customize origin settings
//- Manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure content delivery
//- Monitor and analyze distribution performance
//
//## Key Features
//
//- **Consistent Interface**: Aligns with our existing APIs for deploying open-source software, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.
//- **Simplified Configuration**: Abstracts the underlying AWS configurations, enabling quicker deployments without deep AWS expertise.
//- **Scalability**: Facilitates automatic scaling to handle varying traffic loads efficiently.
//- **Security Integration**: Leverages AWS security features to protect content and ensure secure data transmission.
//
//## Use Cases
//
//- **Web Application Acceleration**: Improve load times by distributing static and dynamic content globally.
//- **Media Streaming**: Deliver high-quality video and audio streams with low latency.
//- **API Endpoint Optimization**: Enhance API responsiveness by caching responses at edge locations.
//
//## Future Enhancements
//
//As this resource is currently in a partial implementation phase, future updates will include:
//
//- Advanced logging and monitoring capabilities
//- Enhanced customization options for caching and routing behaviors
//- Integration with additional AWS services and features
//- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
